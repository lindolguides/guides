# Gems

### Starter Legendary Gems
1. ★★☆☆☆ - Fervant Fang (Free BP40) - does fantastic single target damage. It can easily be acquired from the Battle Pass, without relying on luck from crests.
2. ★★☆☆☆ - Lightning Core - (AOE) does direct damage to an enemy group, often wiping them out in the process. While the damage is infrequent, it's useful for taking down larger targets.
3. ★★☆☆☆ - Power and Command - (dmg, anti cc) Alternates states every nine seconds. Power state increases your primary attack damage by 8%. Command state increases all other skill damage by 8%
4. ★☆☆☆☆ - Trickshot Gem - (less energy) allows you to channel Whirlwind longer, especially when ranked up and awakened! The best 1 star Legendary Gem Whirlwind Barb!
5. ★☆☆☆☆ - Chained Death - (stacks 3x) gives a solid damage boost, especially in AoE situations.
6. ★☆☆☆☆ - Everlasting Torment - (20s cd, 6s dmg) deals incredible damage over time after a Critical Hit. For a simple 1 star Legendary Gem, this packs a punch.
