# PVP - Condemn

*Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/DiabloImmortal/comments/wce6q6/legend_76_win_rate_ultimate_crusader_pvp_guide/*

### Skills:
- Punish: This is important because punish causes "hardened senses" which increases your block chance by 30%. Thus, you always want to weave in an auto attack every two seconds at least to maintain high block. Never go sacred fire, you aren't a DPS. With hardened senses on, your block chance will be near 50%.
- Sacred Chain: This is the most misunderstood, underutilized, and powerful crusader spell in PVP in my opinion. It can be hard to aim if you are new; I still miss often. Base sacred chain sucks since damage interrupts it. But when you make it Frozen Chain it is amazing. Generally, use vortex first to microstun them and that makes hitting sacred chain easier. Also, if an opponent is moving predictably (chasing you in a straight line, running away in a straight line, etc.), then it is easy to land chain to stun them.
- Spinning Shield: Range dmg, AOE dmg, high damage. With pouncing shield, downside is it can be hard to aim, range is not that far either so takes time to master the distance. I still miss it a lot. Very flexible skill. Depending on which legendary essence you select, spinning shield can be used in different ways. This skill is not super critical to the build - if you want to experiment, swap this one
- Condemn: MVP of build when changed to vortex. Vortex does not have to be aimed; you just have to be close to opponent. With draw and quarter and blood-soaked jade, move speed should not be an issue and you should be able to chase them down easily. This ability interrupts all channeling, moves enemy position, interrupts pathing, dismounts crusaders, etc. Use condemn to microstun enemy and then follow up immediately for an easy to hit frozen chain.Note 1: Condemn does NOT interrupt your own draw and quarter, so you can safely cast it while on horse!Note 2: Condemn won't interrupt whirlwind, but it will change the barbarian’s position and pathing.
- Draw and Quarter: Best crusader ability in game. Makes engaging, disengaging, running away, and chasing down low HP enemies a breeze. It dispels all movement impairing effects when cast. With Cavalier’s Courtwear, this heavily disrupts opponents. I generally use it for engaging, but sometimes CD will come off in time to disengage/run away, to peel, or to chase down someone. Very flexible. Condemn does not interrupt draw and quarter, but spinning shield and ice chains will. 18 second cooldown, which is why you mostly engage every 20 seconds.

### Legendary Items:
- Helm: Pride is bait. This causes your sacred chain to pull all the enemies together into one clump. Makes it easy to throw a bouncing shield at them and do a high amount of damage. Also easier for team to AOE them.
- Chest: Iron Suzerain. The MVP of the build. Changes Condemn to Vortex, which continuously pulls enemies towards you (no longer explodes). This is crazy disruptive and throws the opponent around 2 or 3 times thru the duration of spell. Also does great AOE damage if you catch multiple enemies with it.
- Shoulders: Public Penance. Makes sacred chain throws frozen chains that do not break when taking damage. Essentially if you hit an enemy with frozen chain, it pulls all the enemies together and stuns them all even if your team is unloading on them.
- Legs: Cavalier's Courtwear. Generally, draw and quarter is used to engage the backline quickly. But with Courtwear, it can also be used to peel/disrupt channeling/interrupt casting/move enemy position. It causes draw and quarter to slightly stun them/displace them and interferes with opponent's pathing. You can use it to peel melee off your range, chase down enemies for a kill, interrupt, etc. Very valuable and flexible.
- MH: Doesn't matter, we don't use any of these legendary effects. Little Lance is good if you decide to go with falling sword instead of spinning shield.
- Shield:
    - Pouncing shield: Causes spinning shield to bounce back and forth between enemies. Shreds clumped opponents, and your spells clump the opponents. Can also help you last hit a low HP player running away. Can be hard to aim sometimes.
    - Shield alternative if you have problems aiming: Pavise of ten wings requires no aim. Just use it right after they get sucked into vortex and it'll hit them once or twice as they try to escape. It also zones out other opponents until the shield makes all the rotations/disappears.
    - Shield alternative if you want more disrupt: Exploding shield interrupts channeling, does AOE damage, and micro stuns them/messes with pathing. This one does require aim though.
