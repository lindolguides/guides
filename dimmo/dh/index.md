- Multishot (non crit) - 10,850
- Multishot (crit) - 24,847
- Knockbomb (crit) - 14,344 x5
- Not sure what is Knockbomb non crit damage.. I only cast this during smoke crit buff


### Skills
- Basic: Crossbow Shot
- Skill 1: Multishot (3x) (burst)
- Skill 2: Knockbomb (burst)
- Skill 3: Smoke (crit, buff)

### Greens
- 2 Issa + 2 Shal + 2 Windloft (world)
- 4 Vithu + 2 Shal (high basic dps damage)
- 4 Grace + 2 Shal (aoe dot ticks damage)

### Rotation
- Smoke(there's a hidden 0.5 delay to unstealth so knockbomb is perfect as it also has 0.5 casting time), Knockbomb, Multishot 3x(1s gone total cast times), autos (vithu buff 2s), Veng, autos(vithu buff 3s), autos(3-4s without Vithu buff), (repeat)


### Things to note
- *Is it worth to use 4 Grace + Shal than 4 Vithu + 2 Shal and lose the 5s 30% attack speed damage and get much more dot tick damage?*
- *Is it worth to use 4 Shal + 2 Grace and only get 25% constant attack speed all the time and Grace extra dot tick damage?*
- *Dot ticks do crit and indeed ticks a lot*

### Quick PvP strat:
*Crazydiamond:*\
*general speaking there are 3 types of DH in PvP.*

- 1=High reso DH they play PvP like PvE, skill wise. paragon = gladiator for sure
- 2=low reso frost DH, using breath of winter for main hand, icy path/multishot knockback for shoulder and extra swing for head.
- 3=low reso trap DH, the difference between 2 and 3 is trap DH use ice trap as method of CC

*and DH, no matter high reso or low reso, will do best supporting the front line. also, with daring swings, DH can jump over front line and finish those low hp target hiding in the back row and swing back. (risky tho, but can be rewarding if time it correctly)*
